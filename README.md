### Installation via composer:
``` 
composer require rjapi/raml-json-api 
```

### Laravel specific configuration

Add command to ```$commands``` array in ```app/Console/Kernel.php```
```php
protected $commands = [
    RJApiGenerator::class,
];
```

#### Add Service Provider

Next add the following service provider in `config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => [
  Nwidart\Modules\LaravelModulesServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Next, add the following aliases to `aliases` array in the same file.

```php
'aliases' => [
  'Module' => Nwidart\Modules\Facades\Module::class,
],
```

Next publish the package's configuration file by running :

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nwidart\Modules\LaravelModulesServiceProvider"
```

#### Autoloading

By default controllers, entities or repositories are not loaded automatically. You can autoload your modules using `psr-4`. For example :

```json
{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "App\\": "app/",
      "Modules\\": "Modules/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Running generator

Run in console:
```
php artisan raml:generate raml/articles.raml --migrations
```

This command creates the whole environment for You to proceed building complex API based on RAML/Laravel/JSON API, 
in particular: directories for modular app, Controllers/Middlewares/Models+Pivots to support full MVC, 
Routes (JSON API compatible) and even migrations to help You create RDBMS structure.
 
```raml/articles.raml``` - raml file in raml directory in the root of Your project, 
which should be prepared before or You may wish to just try by copying an example from ``` tests/functional/tests/articles.raml```

Options:

```--migrations``` is an option to create migrations (create_entityName_table) for every entity + pivots if there are ManyToMany relationships.

```--regenerate``` use this if You need to rewrite all files generated previously. 
By default generated files preserved to prevent overwriting of added/modified content.   

The output will look something like this:
```
Created : /srv/rjapi-laravel/Modules/V1/start.php
Created : /srv/rjapi-laravel/Modules/V1/Http/routes.php
Created : /srv/rjapi-laravel/Modules/V1/module.json

This is done (behind the scene) by wonderful package laravel-modules, 
many thx to nWidart https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules

```

### RAML Types and Declarations

The ```version``` root property !required
```RAML
version: v1
```
converts to ```/Modules/V1/``` directory.

Types ``` ID, Type, DataObject/DataArray``` are special helper types - !required
```RAML
  ID:
    type: integer
    required: true
    # it will be BIGINT UNSIGNED in migration Schema if maximum > 10
    maximum: 20
  Type:
    type: string
    required: true
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 255
  DataObject:
    type: object
    required: true
  DataArray:
    type: array
    required: true
```

Special data type ``` RelationshipsDataItem ``` - !required
```RAML
  RelationshipsDataItem:
    type: object
    properties:
      id: ID
      type: Type
```
defined in every relationship custom type

Attributes ```*Attributes``` are defined for every custom Object ex.:
```RAML
  ArticleAttributes:
    description: Article attributes description
    type: object
    properties:
      title:
        required: true
        type: string
        minLength: 16
        maxLength: 256
      description:
        required: true
        type: string
        minLength: 32
        maxLength: 1024
      url:
        required: false
        type: string
        minLength: 16
        maxLength: 255
      show_in_top:
        description: Show at the top of main page
        required: false
        type: boolean
      status:
        description: The state of an article
        enum: ["draft", "published", "postponed", "archived"]
      topic_id:
        description: ManyToOne Topic relationship
        required: true
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maximum: 6
      rate:
        type: number
        minimum: 3
        maximum: 9
        format: double     
```

Relationships custom type definition semantics ```*Relationships```
```RAML
  TagRelationships:
    description: Tag relationship description
    type: object
    properties:
      data:
        type: DataArray
        items:
          type: RelationshipsDataItem
```

Complete composite Object looks like this: 
```RAML
  Article:
    type: object
    properties:
      type: Type
      id: ID
      attributes: ArticleAttributes
      relationships:
        type: TagRelationships[] | TopicRelationships
```
That is all that PHP-code generator needs to provide code structure that just works out-fo-the-box within Laravel framework, 
where may any business logic be applied.

To use multiple files processing add (as root element):
```RAML
uses:
  topics: raml/topic.raml
  otherfile: raml/otherFile.raml
  yetanother: raml/yetanother.raml
```
all files will be generated as if they were one composite object.
The thing to note here, is that RAML-spec requires to include all header info 
and dependent types into those included. You can see warning details in Atom IDE with Workbench API plugin, 
or any other RAML analysing tools. 

To set default values for GET query parameters - set QueryParams like this:
```RAML
  QueryParams:
    type: object
    properties:
      page:
        type: integer
        required: false
        default: 10
        description: page number
      limit:
        type: integer
        required: false
        default: 15
        description: elements per page
      sort:
        type: string
        required: false
        pattern: "asc|desc"
        default: "desc"
      access_token:
        type: string
        required: true
        example: db7329d5a3f381875ea6ce7e28fe1ea536d0acaf
        description: sha1 example
        default: db7329d5a3f381875ea6ce7e28fe1ea536d0acaf        
```
it will be used on requests similar to: ```http://example.com/v1/article?include=tag``` 
where no params were passed.  

Complete directory structure after generator will end up it`s work will be like:
```php
Modules/{ModuleName}/Http/Controllers/ - contains controllers that extends the DefaultController (descendant of Laravel's Controller)
Modules/{ModuleName}/Http/Middleware/ - contains forms that extends the BaseFormRequest (descendant of Laravel's FormRequest) and validates input attributes (that were previously defined as *Attributes in RAML)
Modules/{ModuleName}/Entities/ - contains mappers that extends the BaseModel (descendant of Laravel's Model) and maps attributes to RDBMS
Modules/{ModuleName}/Http/routes.php - contains routings pointing to controllers with JSON API protocol support
Modules/{ModuleName}/Database/Migrations/ - contains migrations created with option --migrations
```

### Generated files content

DefaultController example:
```php
<?php
namespace Modules\V1\Http\Controllers;

class ArticleController extends DefaultController 
{

}
```
By default every controller works with any of GET - index/view, POST - create, PATCH - update, DELETE - delete methods.
So You don't need to implement anything special here.

Validation BaseFormRequest example:
```php
<?php
namespace Modules\V1\Http\Middleware;

use rjapi\extension\BaseFormRequest;

class ArticleMiddleware extends BaseFormRequest 
{
    public $id = null;
    // Attributes
    public $title = null;
    public $description = null;
    public $url = null;
    public $show_in_top = null;
    public $status = null;
    public $topic_id = null;

    public function authorize(): bool {
        return true;
    }

    public function rules(): array {
        return [
            "title" => "required|string|min:16|max:256",
            "description" => "required|string|min:32|max:1024",
            "url" => "string|min:16|max:255",
            // Show at the top of main page
            "show_in_top" => "boolean",
            // The state of an article
            "status" => "in:draft,published,postponed,archived",
            // ManyToOne Topic relationship
            "topic_id" => "required|integer|min:1|max:9",
        ];
    }

    public function relations(): array {
        return [
            "tag",
            "topic",
        ];
    }

}
```

BaseModel example:
```php
<?php
namespace Modules\V1\Entities;

use rjapi\extension\BaseModel;

class Article extends BaseModel 
{
    protected $primaryKey = "id";
    protected $table = "article";
    public $timestamps = false;

    public function tag() {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Tag::class, 'tag_article');
    }

    public function topic() {
        return $this->belongsTo(Topic::class);
    }

}
```

Routes will be created in ```/Modules/{ModuleName}/Http/routes.php``` file, for every entity defined in raml:
```php
Route::group(['prefix' => 'v1', 'namespace' => 'Modules\\V1\\Http\\Controllers'], function()
{
    Route::get('/article', 'ArticleController@index');
    Route::get('/article/{id}', 'ArticleController@view');
    Route::post('/article', 'ArticleController@create');
    Route::patch('/article/{id}', 'ArticleController@update');
    Route::delete('/article/{id}', 'ArticleController@delete');
    // relation routes
    Route::get('/article/{id}/relationships/{relations}', 'ArticleController@relations');
    Route::post('/article/{id}/relationships/{relations}', 'ArticleController@createRelations');
    Route::patch('/article/{id}/relationships/{relations}', 'ArticleController@updateRelations');
    Route::delete('/article/{id}/relationships/{relations}', 'ArticleController@deleteRelations');
});
```

Generated migrations will look like standard migrations in Laravel:
```php
<?php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateArticleTable extends Migration 
{
    public function up() 
    {
        Schema::create('article', function(Blueprint $table) {
            $table->bigIncrements('id');
            $table->string('title', 256);
            $table->string('description', 1024);
            $table->string('url', 255);
            // Show at the top of main page
            $table->unsignedTinyInteger('show_in_top');
            $table->enum('status', ["draft","published","postponed","archived"]);
            // ManyToOne Topic relationship
            $table->unsignedMediumInteger('topic_id');
            $table->double('rate', 9, 3);
            $table->date('date_posted');
            $table->time('time_to_live');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down() 
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('article');
    }

}
```
Note, that U have an ability to make any ranges for varchar, integer types through minLength/maxLength and minimum/maximum respectively. 
For instance, integer can be set to unsigned smallint with 
`minimum: 1` (any number > 0) and `maximum: 2` (any number <= 3 to fit smallint db type range).  

All migrations for specific module will be placed in ``` Modules/{ModuleName}/Database/Migrations/ ```

To execute them all - run: ``` php artisan module:migrate ```

Also worth to mention - Laravel uses table_id convention to link tables via foreign key.
So U can either follow the default - add to RAML an id that matches to the table name 
(just like in example: `topic_id` -> in article table for topic table `id`, see `ArticleAttributes` in RAML Types and Declarations) 
or make Your own foreign key and add it to ```hasMany/belongsTo -> $foreignKey``` parameter in generated BaseModel entity.

### Relationships particular qualities
To let generator know about what a particular relationship to apply (ex.: ManyToMany, OneToMany, OneToOne) 
set the ```relationships``` property in an Entity like so - for ex. let's see how to set ManyToOne relationship between Article and Tag entities.

Define Article with relationships like:
```
relationships:
  type: TagRelationships[]
```
and Tag with relationships like:
```
relationships:
  type: ArticleRelationships
```
This way You telling to generator: "make the relation between Article and Tag OneToMany from Article to Tag"
The idea works with any relationship You need - ex. ManyToMany: ```TagRelationships[] -> ArticleRelationships[]```, 
OneToOne: ```TagRelationships -> ArticleRelationships```

You can also bind several relationships to one entity, for instance - 
You have an Article entity that must be bound to TagRelationships and TopicRelationships, this can be done similar to:
```
relationships:
    type: TagRelationships[] | TopicRelationships
```
or vise versa 
```
relationships:
    type: TopicRelationships | TagRelationships[]
```
Generator will independently detect all relationships between entities.

### Query parameters

You may want to use additional query parameters to fetch includes 
and/or pagination, for instance:
```php
http://example.com/v1/article?include=tag&page=2&limit=10&sort=asc
```

You may not wish to drag all the attributes/fields: 
```php
http://example.com/v1/article/1?include=tag&data=["title", "description"]
```
Note: data array items MUST be set in double quotes.

or You may want to ORDER BY several columns in different directions:
```php
http://example.com/v1/article/1?include=tag&order_by={"title":"asc", "created_at":"desc"}
```

Also, You have an ability to filter results this way:
```php
http://example.com/v1/article?include=tag&filter=[["updated_at", ">", "2017-01-03 12:13:13"], ["updated_at", "<", "2017-01-03 12:13:15"]]
```
those arrays will be put to Laravel where clause and accordingly protected by param bindings. 

The dynamic module name similar to: v1, v2 - will be taken on runtime 
as the last element of the array in ```config/module.php``` file, 
if You, by strange circumstances, want to use one of the previous modules, 
just set one of previously registered modules as the last element of an array.  

An example of auto-generated ```config/module.php```:
```php
<?php
return [
    'modules'=> [
        'v1',
    ]
];
```

To get configuration parameters at runtime generator will create content 
in ```Modules/{ModuleName}/Config/config.php``` file:
```php
<?php
return [
    'name'=>'V1',
    'query_params'=> [
        // default settings
        'limit' => 15,
        'sort' => 'desc',
        // access token to check via global middleware
        'access_token' => 'db7329d5a3f381875ea6ce7e28fe1ea536d0acaf',
    ],
];
```

### Security

#### Static access token
In ```QueryParams``` RAML types You can declare the ```access_token``` property, that will be placed to ```Modules/{ModuleName}/Config/config.php```.
Generator will create ```app/Http/Middleware/ApiAccessToken.php``` global middleware.
 
To activate this check on every request - add ApiAccessToken middleware to ```app/Http/Middleware/Kernel.php```, ex.:
```php
class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    /**
     * The application's global HTTP middleware stack.
     *
     * These middleware are run during every request to your application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $middleware = [
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\ApiAccessToken::class,
    ];
```
Generated configuration part:
```php
    'query_params'=> [
        'limit' => 15,
        'sort' => 'desc',
        'access_token' => 'db7329d5a3f381875ea6ce7e28fe1ea536d0acaf',
    ],
```

#### JWT (Json Web Token)

To support a JWT check, You need to add to any users, employees, 
customers like table the ```jwt``` and ```password``` RAML properties:
```RAML
  password:
    description: user password to refresh JWT (encrypted with password_hash)
    required: true
    type: string
    maxLength: 255
  jwt:
    description: Special field to run JWT Auth via requests
    required: true
    type: string
    minLength: 256
    maxLength: 512
    default: ' '
```
The ```maxLength``` parameter is important, because of varchar-type sql field will be created with length 512.

The ```default``` value should be equal precisely ' ' - empty string with space.  

JWT specific configuration will be appended by generator in ```Modules/{ModuleName}/Config/config.php```:
```php
    'jwt'=> [
        'enabled' => true,
        'table' => 'user',
        'activate' => 30,
        'expires' => 3600,
    ],
```

As for any standard Laravel middleware register it in ```app/Http/Kernel.php``` :
```php
    /**
     * The application's route middleware.
     *
     * These middleware may be assigned to groups or used individually.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'jwt' => \rjapi\extension\BaseJwt::class,    
```

And just use this middleware in any requests U need defining 
it in ```Modules/{ModuleName}/Http/routes.php```, ex: 

To declare JWT check only for one specific route: 
```php
Route::get('/article', 'ArticleController@index')->middleware('jwt');
```

To declare JWT check for routes group: 
```php
Route::group(['middleware' => 'jwt', 
```
JWT will be created on POST and updated on PATCH request to the entity You've been created, 
for instance, if You send POST request to ```http://example.com/v1/user``` with the following content:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type":"user",
    "attributes": {
      "first_name":"Alice",
      "last_name":"Hacker",
      "password":"my123Password"
    }
  }
}
``` 

Response will be similar to: 
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "7",
    "attributes": {
      "first_name": "Alice",
      "last_name": "Hacker",
      "password": null,
      "jwt": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImp0aSI6IjU4ODljOGY2NzE3YjIifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJsYXJhdmVsLmxvYyIsImF1ZCI6ImxhcmF2ZWwubG9jIiwianRpIjoiNTg4OWM4ZjY3MTdiMiIsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTQyNDg4NiwibmJmIjoxNDg1NDI0OTE2LCJleHAiOjE0ODU0Mjg0ODYsInVpZCI6N30.JnC7OhlUIBoMTlu617q0q2nCQ4SqKh19bXtiHfBeg9o",
      "attributes": null,
      "request": null,
      "query": null,
      "server": null,
      "files": null,
      "cookies": null,
      "headers": null
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "laravel.loc/user/7"
    }
  }
}
```
Note if JWT ```enabled=true```, password will be hashed with ```password_hash``` and saved to password field internally.
Do not bother with ```"password": null,``` attribute it is unset before output for safety.
You can add additional checks on password or other fields ex.: length, strength etc in Model on befor/afterSave events.

An example for JWT refresh - ```http://example.com/v1/user/4```:
 
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type":"user",
    "attributes": {
    	"password":"myPassword123",
    	"jwt":true
    }
  }
}
```
Note that password and jwt set to true are required. 

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "4",
    "attributes": {
      "first_name": "Alice",
      "last_name": "Hacker",
      "jwt": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImp0aSI6IjU4ODcwNGU1NTRjNzkifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJsYXJhdmVsLmxvYyIsImF1ZCI6ImxhcmF2ZWwubG9jIiwianRpIjoiNTg4NzA0ZTU1NGM3OSIsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTI0MzYyMSwibmJmIjoxNDg1MjQzNjUxLCJleHAiOjE0ODUyNDcyMjEsInVpZCI6NH0.GD96ewc1dhbpz9grNaE2070Qy30Mqkh3B0VpEb7h3mQ",

Regular request with JWT will look like:

```
 
The algorithm to sign the token is HS256, it can be changed in future releases 
with additional user-defined options to let developers choose another. 
However, HMAC SHA-256 is the most popular these days. 
 
### Turn off JSON API support
If you are willing to disable json api specification mappings into Laravel application (for instance - You need to generate MVC-structure into laravel-module and make Your own json schema, or any other output format), just set ```$jsonApi``` property in DefaultController to false:
```php
<?php
namespace Modules\V1\Http\Controllers;

use rjapi\extension\BaseController;

class DefaultController extends BaseController 
{
    protected $jsonApi = false;
}
```
As this class inherited by all Controllers - You don't have to add this property in every Controller class.
By default JSON API is turned on.

### Tree structures

You can easily build a tree structure by declaring it in RAML as `Trees` custom type:   
```RAML
  Trees:
    type: object
    properties:
      menu:
        type: boolean
        default: true
      catalog:
        type: boolean
        default: false
```

and adding `parent_id` to the targeted table, ex.:
```RAML
  MenuAttributes:
    type: object
    properties:
      title:
        required: true
        type: string
      rfc:
        type: string
        default: /
      parent_id:
        description: mandatory field for building trees
        type: integer
        minimum: 9
        maximum: 10
        default: 0
```
the entire tree will be placed in `meta` json-api root element, 
while all the parent elements (stored as parent_id=0) will reside in data root element.
This was done to keep steady json-api structure and it's relations.

Meta data response example: 
```json
  "meta": {
    "menu_tree": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "ttl1",
        "rfc": "/",
        "parent_id": 0,
        "created_at": null,
        "updated_at": null,
        "children": [
          {
            "id": 3,
            "title": "ttl21",
            "rfc": "/",
            "parent_id": 1,
            "created_at": null,
            "updated_at": null,
            "children": []
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "ttl2",
            "rfc": "/",
            "parent_id": 1,
            "created_at": null,
            "updated_at": null,
            "children": [
              {
                "id": 4,
                "title": "ttl3",
                "rfc": "/",
                "parent_id": 2,
                "created_at": null,
                "updated_at": null,
                "children": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

Children elements stuck in every parent's `children` property array and it is empty if there are none.      

To get a sub-trees of a top most ancestors - simply execute GET request for the item, ex.: `http://example.com/v1/menu/1`.
See wiki page for real-world examples with Postman.

### Conversions to RAML

There are several tools for conversion between different types of documents and RAML, 
one of the most famous (at this moment) is [APIMATIC](https://apimatic.io/transformer), 
so there is no problem if You like ex.: Swagger, but want to use raml-json-api to build Your application with RAML.
